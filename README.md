ShellScript to open YouTube Videos in VLC with a single click.

Usage
-----
Run ;o - then copy a youtube URL to the clipboard - using the right click context menu in most browsers.
Personally my preferred method of link acquisition is to place my favorite channels into categories in an RSS reader.
Thus quick access to new links allows me to digest.

Dependencies
------------
xsel - used to capture text from the clipboard.
vlc  - used to display your video!

-Enjoy.
