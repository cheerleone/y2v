y2v YouTube to VLC
==================

ShellScript to open YouTube Videos in VLC with a single click.

Usage
-----
Run ;o - then copy a youtube URL to the clipboard - using the right click context menu in most browsers.
Personally my preferred method of link acquisition is to place my favorite channels into categories in an RSS reader.
Thus quick access to new links allows me to digest.

Dependencies
------------
xsel - used to capture text from the clipboard.

vlc  - used to display your video!

Known Issues
------------

Pausing VLC for an exsessive time will cause youtube to disconnect, VLC will appear to cut-short the video.

-Enjoy.
